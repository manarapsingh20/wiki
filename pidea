	<p>Nike, Inc., an <strong>American</strong> multinational corporation renowned for its extensive range of sports equipment, apparel, and notably footwear, began its journey in 1964 as <strong>Blue Ribbon Sports</strong>, founded by Bill Bowerman, a track-and-field coach, and Phil Knight, a student athlete at the <em>University of Oregon</em>, initially operating as a distributor for the Japanese shoemaker Onitsuka Tiger. Nike's philosophy of innovative design and endorsement by athletes quickly helped it gain prominence, with a pivotal moment in its history being the launch of the <strong><em>Nike Air technology</em></strong>in 1979, a technology that incorporated a flexible, yet durable air pocket into the sole of the shoe, designed to provide superior cushioning and support for athletes, setting a new standard in athletic shoe comfort and performance. <br><br>The introduction of the <strong>Air Jordan</strong> in 1984, created in collaboration with <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>, then a rising star in the NBA, reshaped the landscape of basketball footwear, as the sneaker was not only a technical achievement with its unique design and air sole cushioning but also became a symbol of style and culture, growing into a massive standalone label under Nike, with a range of products that extended beyond basketball shoes to include athletic and casual wear. Throughout the years, both Nike and the Jordan brand have been at the forefront of innovation in shoe technology and design, consistently pushing the boundaries, whether it be through the introduction of new materials, like <strong><em>Flyknit technology</em></strong>, or through smart collaborations with athletes, designers, and cultural icons, helping Nike maintain its position as one of the world's leading athletic footwear and apparel companies. <br><br>Nike's impact extends beyond the realm of sports, influencing fashion, culture, and lifestyle across the globe, with the brand's ability to blend performance with style making it a favorite among athletes, celebrities, and everyday consumers alike, and the story of Nike and the Air Jordan stands as a testament to the power of branding, innovation, and the enduring appeal of sports and sports icons.</p>

  <p>Founded in 1948 by <strong>Rudolf Dassler</strong>, Puma emerged from a family feud that also birthed its rival, Adidas. The brand gained fame with innovative <strong><em>football boots, highlighted by Pel√©'s choice in the 1958 World Cup</em>.</strong> Puma's Suede model, launched in 1968, became a cultural icon beyond sports. In the 1980s, Puma began athlete endorsements, signing stars like Diego Maradona. The brand later expanded into fashion, collaborating with top designers.
